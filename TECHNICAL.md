# Technical Article: The Technology Behind ChartWise

**Introduction**

Understanding the technology behind ChartWise reveals how we achieve robust performance and precise trading insights. This article provides a detailed look into the tools and architecture that power ChartWise, focusing on the technologies and custom implementations that make it effective.

**Frontend Development**

ChartWise’s frontend is built using **Next.js** and **TypeScript**. TypeScript is used throughout the codebase, both on the frontend and backend. It’s my preferred language due to its strong type safety, superior developer experience, and compatibility across different environments such as frontend, backend, and mobile applications. This consistency is crucial for maintaining high code quality and ensuring smooth integration across various parts of the system.

**Backend Architecture**

On the backend, **TypeScript** and **Express.js** are utilized. TypeScript’s static type checking aids in reducing bugs and improving maintainability, while Express.js handles API development and data management efficiently. 

We chose **MongoDB** for data storage due to my familiarity with it and the extensive boilerplate code available from previous projects. MongoDB’s flexibility and scalability fit well with the diverse data requirements of ChartWise, allowing for efficient data management and retrieval.

**BullMQ Implementation**

For job and message queue management, ChartWise uses **BullMQ**. Our implementation of BullMQ is custom and includes the **WorkerManager** and **QueueManager** classes. The **WorkerManager** handles the execution of tasks in parallel, while the **QueueManager** is responsible for organizing and prioritizing tasks. This setup ensures that chart analysis requests are processed efficiently and reliably, maintaining high performance even with concurrent tasks.

**Integration and Real-Time Updates**

ChartWise integrates **OpenAI’s GPT-4 Vision** capabilities for advanced analysis. GPT-4 Vision allows ChartWise to interpret and analyze charts with a high level of accuracy, providing insightful recommendations based on visual data. 

Real-time updates are managed through a polling mechanism where the frontend periodically checks for updates from the backend. This ensures that users receive the latest analysis results promptly, enhancing the user experience by keeping information current.

**Conclusion**

The technology stack behind ChartWise is carefully chosen to deliver performance and reliability. Using **TypeScript** throughout the codebase ensures consistent and high-quality development, while **MongoDB** supports flexible data management. Our custom **BullMQ** implementation, featuring **WorkerManager** and **QueueManager** classes, optimizes job processing, and **OpenAI’s GPT-4 Vision** capabilities enhance our analytical power. These technologies and custom solutions work together to make ChartWise a powerful tool for traders, providing accurate, actionable insights and efficient execution of trading strategies.
