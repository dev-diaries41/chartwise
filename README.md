Trading in the financial markets, whether it's forex, stocks, or cryptocurrency, is a mix of highs and lows. For many traders, the challenge isn’t just finding good trades but executing them effectively. This was my struggle, and it led me to create ChartWise—a tool aimed at making trade execution simpler and more reliable.

## The Challenge: Trading Execution Issues

In my trading journey, I've experienced both gains and losses to say the least. I often had a good sense of when to enter a trade but struggled with executing it properly. This gap in execution often resulted in losses despite having the right strategy. ChartWise was developed to address this issue by providing clear, actionable insights for better trade execution.

## What Is ChartWise?

ChartWise is designed to help traders analyse charts and create effective trade plans. You start by uploading a screenshot of your chart and inputting details about your trading strategy and risk tolerance. ChartWise then generates a detailed analysis and execution plan tailored to your inputs, leveraging advanced technical analysis and artificial intelligence.

## Why ChartWise Can Help

The main goal of ChartWise is to bridge the gap between understanding a trade and executing it well. It’s not just for beginners trying to get a handle on charts, but also for experienced traders who want to refine their strategies and avoid common mistakes. By offering structured analysis and actionable plans, ChartWise helps ensure that you follow through on your trading insights effectively.

## How ChartWise Was Built

ChartWise combines modern technologies to deliver a seamless experience. I used Next.js and TypeScript for a responsive and robust frontend, ensuring an intuitive user interface. On the backend, TypeScript, Express.js, and MongoDB work together to handle data efficiently. BullMQ manages job queues to process chart analyses quickly, while OpenAI enhances the analysis capabilities using AI and computer vision. For those interested in the technical details, you can explore my technical breakdown article for a deeper dive.

## Conclusion

ChartWise is a tool created out of necessity to improve trading execution. It simplifies the process of analyzing charts and turning that analysis into actionable trade plans. Whether you're new to trading or have years of experience, ChartWise aims to help you execute your trades more effectively.

If you’re looking to make more informed trading decisions and improve your execution strategy, give ChartWise a try. It’s designed to support you in navigating the complexities of trading with greater confidence and precision.
